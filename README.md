## Movie Recommendation System

### Overview
This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. The goal is to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and past interactions.

### Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on movie attributes (genre, director, etc.).
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user-item interaction data to suggest movies.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines both techniques for improved recommendations.
- **Visualization**: Generates insights into movie ratings and user preferences.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently using Python libraries.

### ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ movie_recommendation_system.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook with the complete implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                              # Folder containing movie datasets (if applicable)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                          # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt                    # Dependencies for running the project
```

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (Numerical computing)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine learning models)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Surprise** (Collaborative filtering techniques)
- **NLTK / TF-IDF** (For text-based recommendations)

### Usage
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook movie_recommendation_system.ipynb
   ```
3. **Explore recommendations**:
   - Input a movie title to get similar recommendations.
   - Provide a user ID to receive personalized suggestions.

### Dataset
- The project utilizes **MovieLens** or any custom dataset with user ratings, genres, and metadata.

### Future Enhancements
- Deploy as a web app using **Flask** or **Streamlit**.
- Integrate **deep learning** models for better accuracy.
- Include **real-time recommendations**.
